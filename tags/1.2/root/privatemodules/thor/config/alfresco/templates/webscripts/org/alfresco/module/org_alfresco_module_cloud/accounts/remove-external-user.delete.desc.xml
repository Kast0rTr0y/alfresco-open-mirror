   <shortname>Remove a user from an account</shortname>
   <description>
   This webscript can be used to remove an internal or an external user from an account/network. The meaning of 'remove' depends on
   the user's relationship to the network. If the user is an external user in the specified network (i.e. it is a secondary account
   for that user) then the user will be removed from the network and will still be able to access any of their other networks.
   <p/>
   However if the user is an internal member (i.e. it is their home network) then they will be removed from all networks (secondary and
   home networks) and their authentication details will be removed from the system. The user will no longer be able to use the system at all.
   <p/>
   Note that only NetworkAdmins can call this webscript. Also note that if the user to be removed is the last network admin in a network,
   then the remove will not succeed and a 403 will be returned.
