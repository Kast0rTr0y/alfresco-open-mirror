   SSO (SingleSignOn) Authentication response received from iDP
   
   Note: could be called directly (IdP-initiated) or following an SP-initiated auth request
   
   http://<host>:<port>/alfresco/s/internal/saml/acs/{network_domain}
   http://<host>:<port>/alfresco/service/internal/saml/acs/{network_domain}
   
   The body will contain the signed and base64-encoded XML (SAML Authentication Response)
   
   Example body:
   
   {
      TODO ...
   }
   
   We will trust the pre-authentication, if:
   - the specified network is iDP-controlled (and has an associated iDP public certificate)
   - response can be base64 decoded and the digital signature validated (against the certificate)
   - extracted principal (userId) is an primary member of the network
   - ...
   
   Example response from this web script:
   
   { 
     "ticket" : "abcdefgh123456", 
     "userId" : "my.user@acme.co.uk" 
   }
   
   Notes:
   - Share will make a proxied call to this (unauthenticated) webscript
   - if the Network is not SAML-enabled (under iDP-control) then the webscript will return 401
