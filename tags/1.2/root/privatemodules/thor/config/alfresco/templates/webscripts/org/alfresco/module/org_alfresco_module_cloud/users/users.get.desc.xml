   <description><![CDATA[
      Get a collection of people in the current network stored in the repository. This can optionally be
      filtered according to a given filter query string.
      <p/>
      Sample query parameters and their meanings
      <ul>
        <li>skipCount the number of people to skip</li>
        <li>maxItems the number of people to return in the page</li>
        <li>filter=fred = people whose first names, last names or usernames start with 'fred'.</li>
        <li>sortBy : 'lastName' or 'firstName' </li>
        <li>internal not specified = all people visible on this tenant.</li>
        <li>internal = true (case-sensitive) = all people who are internal on this tenant.</li>
        <li>internal = false = all people who are external on this tenant.</li>
        <li>networkAdmin = true (case-sensitive) = all people who are network admins on this tenant.</li>
      </ul>
      <p/>
      The query params can be used together.
      
      Note: the results are post filtered, which means that the pages may be truncated. Until we get aspect support in the
      canned queries, there isn't much we can do about that.
