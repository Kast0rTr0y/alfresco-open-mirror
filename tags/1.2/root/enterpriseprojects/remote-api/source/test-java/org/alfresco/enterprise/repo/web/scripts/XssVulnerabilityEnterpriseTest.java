/**
 * https://issues.alfresco.com/jira/browse/MNT-13180
 * 
 * Enterprise version of the test
 * 
 * Customer would like to be sure that we protect ourselves against unsanitized user inputs that can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
 * This probably means (at least) implementing a Unit Test framework that injects into each webscript listed at:
 * http://localhost:8080/alfresco/wcservice/index/uri/
 * and for each documented parameter malicious input such as those used by our customer to detect the ones he found
