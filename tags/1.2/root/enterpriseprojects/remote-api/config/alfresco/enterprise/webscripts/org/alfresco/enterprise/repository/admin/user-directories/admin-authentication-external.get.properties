authentication-external.title=Edit External Directory - {0}
authentication-external.intro-text=The external authentication subsystem can be used to integrate Alfresco with any external authentication system. It can be integrated with your application server so that the identity of the logged-in user is passed to servlets via the HttpServletRequest.getRemoteUser() method. As this is the standard way for application servers to propagate user identities to servlets, it is compatible with a number of SSO solutions, including Central Authentication Service (CAS).
