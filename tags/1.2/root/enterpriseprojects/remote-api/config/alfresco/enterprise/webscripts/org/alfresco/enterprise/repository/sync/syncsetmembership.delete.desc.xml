   <shortname>DELETE SyncSet Membership</shortname>
   <description><![CDATA[Web Script that removes a given NodeRef from a syncSet (Unsync) with option to request delete of remote node(s). 
   Notes:
   - unsync of folder will cause unsync of children (recursive if the syncSet was setup with includeSubFolders)
   - requested delete of remote node(s) => target, if the unsync is performed on the source
   <p/>
   The request will be of the form:
   <pre>
   DELETE .../sync/syncsetmembers/workspace/SpacesStore/9319d5a3-03c1-4f86-8b44-f8516ff91820?deleteRemote=true
   <p/>
   The response body will be of the form:
   <pre>
   {
      "success" : true
   }
   </pre>
   If there is no nodeRef matching the specified id or if the nodeRef is not a member of a SyncSet, a 404 will be returned.
